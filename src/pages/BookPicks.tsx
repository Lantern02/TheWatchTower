      author: 'Rainer Maria Rilke',
      category: 'Writing',
      description: 'Rilke\'s tender guidance to a young poet seeking advice about art, love, and life. These letters are filled with wisdom about solitude, creativity, and the courage to live authentically.',

      title: 'The Wisdom of Insecurity',
      author: 'Alan Watts',
      category: 'Philosophy',
      description: 'Watts explores the anxiety that comes from trying to find security in an inherently insecure world, offering instead a path toward embracing uncertainty as the foundation of a fulfilling life.',
      why: 'In our culture of constant planning and control, Watts offers the radical idea that true peace comes from dancing with uncertainty rather than fighting against it.',
